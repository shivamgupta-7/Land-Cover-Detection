My research illustrates an innovative approach of using remote sensing in integration with GIS for forest cover assessment using U-Net convolutional network architecture and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. 


NDVI classification was used to identify the bands and extract pixel information to analyze the forest cover of the area. The categorization of satellite data into six different classes is contingent on canopy density and water bodies for assessment and change detection of forest cover. 


The forest cover of Shimla Municipal Forests located in the Western Himalayas was studied for the years 2015 and 2019. The neural network model was trained for 50 epochs.  


The results yielded a high training accuracy of 94 percent along with a validation accuracy of 85 percent. Thus, U-Net trained with Sentinel-2 data was able to demonstrate a more efficient, optimized, and cost-effective method for forest cover mapping.
